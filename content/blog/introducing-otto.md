# Introducing Otto: The AI-Powered Slackbot for AWS User Group Leaders

Running an AWS User Group is rewarding but can be time-consuming. From organizing events and creating promotional materials to managing communications and engaging with members, there's a lot to handle. That's why we're excited to introduce **Otto**, our new AI-powered Slackbot designed specifically for AWS User Group leaders.

## What is Otto?

Otto is a Slackbot that helps user group leaders automate common tasks and create engaging content for their communities. Built with the latest AI technologies, Otto can handle a variety of tasks that typically require significant time and effort.

## Key Features

### 1. Meetup Agenda Generation

One of Otto's most powerful features is its ability to generate professional meetup agendas from Sessionize information. Simply provide Otto with your Sessionize event ID, and it will:

- Extract session details, speaker information, and schedules
- Format everything into a clean, professional agenda
- Include speaker bios and session descriptions
- Generate a ready-to-use agenda for your Meetup page or website

### 2. Event Header Image Creation

Creating eye-catching graphics for your events no longer requires design skills or expensive software. Otto can generate custom header images for your meetups with:

- Your user group's branding and colors
- Event details including date, time, and location
- Speaker information and session titles
- AWS service icons relevant to your event topics

### 3. Automated Announcements

Keep your community informed with automated event announcements. Otto can:

- Create and schedule announcement messages for Slack
- Generate email templates for event communications
- Prepare social media posts for Twitter, LinkedIn, and other platforms
- Send reminders to registered attendees before events

### 4. Community Insights

Otto provides valuable insights about your community engagement, helping you understand:

- Which topics generate the most interest
- Attendance patterns and trends
- Member engagement metrics
- Suggestions for future event topics based on community interests

## How Otto Works

Otto integrates seamlessly with your Slack workspace and connects to various APIs including Meetup, Sessionize, and AWS services. Using natural language processing and generative AI, Otto can understand your requests and produce high-quality content tailored to your specific needs.

## Getting Started with Otto

Getting started with Otto is simple:

1. Add Otto to your Slack workspace using our [installation link](https://github.com/aws-user-group-toolkit/otto)
2. Connect your Meetup and Sessionize accounts (if applicable)
3. Start interacting with Otto using simple commands

Here's an example of how to generate a meetup agenda:

```
@otto generate agenda for sessionize event 1234
```

Or create a header image:

```
@otto create header image for "Serverless September Meetup" on September 15, 2025
```

## The Technology Behind Otto

Otto is built using a combination of technologies:

- **AWS Lambda** for serverless backend processing
- **Amazon Bedrock** for AI capabilities
- **AWS Step Functions** for orchestrating complex workflows
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for data storage
- **Slack Bolt Framework** for Slack integration

The entire project is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-user-group-toolkit/otto), where you can contribute to its development.

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning for Otto. We have an exciting roadmap ahead, including:

- Integration with more platforms like Discord and Microsoft Teams
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Personalized content recommendations
- Automated follow-up surveys and feedback collection
- Speaker management and communication tools

## Join the Beta Program
