# 10 Tips for Running a Successful AWS User Group

Building and maintaining an active AWS User Group requires dedication, planning, and community engagement. As someone who has been involved with AWS User Groups for years, I've seen what works and what doesn't. In this post, I'll share 10 essential tips for running a successful AWS User Group, based on experiences from community leaders around the world.

## 1. Define Your Group's Purpose and Values

Every successful user group starts with a clear purpose. Ask yourself:

- What specific needs does your group address in your local community?
- What makes your group unique compared to other tech meetups?
- What values do you want your community to embody?

For example, your purpose might be "To create a supportive environment where AWS professionals in [your city] can learn, network, and grow together." Your values might include inclusivity, knowledge sharing, and professional growth.

Having a well-defined purpose helps you make decisions about content, speakers, and activities that align with your group's goals.

## 2. Build a Leadership Team

Running a user group shouldn't be a one-person job. Build a team of co-organizers who can share responsibilities and bring diverse perspectives:

- **Content coordinator**: Finds speakers and plans session topics
- **Logistics manager**: Handles venue arrangements and event setup
- **Community manager**: Engages with members and manages communications
- **Sponsorship coordinator**: Works with sponsors to secure funding and resources

Having a team not only distributes the workload but also ensures continuity if someone needs to step back from their role.

## 3. Create a Consistent Meeting Schedule

Consistency is key to building attendance and engagement. Whether you meet monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly:

- Choose a regular day (e.g., "first Thursday of the month")
- Select a consistent time that works for your community
- Announce dates well in advance so people can plan accordingly

A predictable schedule makes it easier for members to incorporate your events into their routines and increases the likelihood of regular attendance.

## 4. Diversify Your Content

Keep your meetups fresh and engaging by offering a variety of content formats:

- **Technical deep dives**: Detailed explorations of specific AWS services
- **Case studies**: Real-world examples of AWS implementations
- **Hands-on workshops**: Interactive learning sessions
- **Lightning talks**: Short presentations on various topics
- **Panel discussions**: Conversations with multiple experts
- **Networking activities**: Structured opportunities for members to connect

Survey your members regularly to understand which formats they find most valuable and adjust accordingly.

## 5. Cultivate a Speaker Pipeline

Finding speakers is often one of the biggest challenges for user group leaders. Build a sustainable speaker pipeline by:

- Creating a simple speaker submission form on your website
- Reaching out to local companies using AWS
- Connecting with AWS Heroes and Community Builders
- Encouraging first-time speakers with mentorship
- Inviting speakers from other user groups (virtually if needed)
- Developing members into speakers through workshops and support

Remember that not every speaker needs to be an expert. Sometimes the most valuable talks come from people sharing their learning journey or specific challenges they've overcome.

## 6. Leverage Available Resources

AWS provides numerous resources for user group leaders:

- **AWS User Group Program**: Official support including potential funding
- **AWS Credits**: For hands-on labs and demonstrations
- **Speaker Connections**: Access to AWS employees and experts
- **Swag and Promotional Materials**: For giveaways and events

Beyond AWS, explore partnerships with:
- Local tech companies for venue sponsorship
- Training providers for educational resources
- Recruitment firms for networking events
- Other tech communities for joint meetups

## 7. Create an Inclusive Environment

Building an inclusive community should be a priority:

- Establish and enforce a clear code of conduct
- Ensure venues are accessible to people with disabilities
- Consider the timing of events to accommodate different schedules
- Actively recruit diverse speakers and topics
- Create opportunities for new members to feel welcome
- Consider childcare options for parent attendees
- Offer virtual participation options when possible

An inclusive group attracts a wider range of participants, leading to richer discussions and a stronger community.

## 8. Develop a Communication Strategy

Effective communication keeps your community engaged:

- **Website/Landing Page**: Central hub for information
- **Meetup/Eventbrite**: Event management and RSVPs
- **Slack/Discord**: Ongoing community discussions
- **Social Media**: Promotion and community building
- **Email Newsletter**: Regular updates and announcements

Be consistent with your communications, but avoid overwhelming members with too many messages. Quality over quantity is the key.

## 9. Measure and Adapt

Track metrics to understand what's working and what isn't:

- **Attendance**: Overall numbers and trends
- **Retention**: How many members return for multiple events
- **Engagement**: Participation in discussions and activities
- **Feedback**: Formal and informal input from attendees
- **Speaker Diversity**: Variety of perspectives represented
- **Content Balance**: Mix of topics and formats

Use this data to make informed decisions about future events and group direction.

## 10. Use Tools to Automate and Streamline

Take advantage of tools that can reduce administrative burden:

- **Otto Slackbot**: Our AI-powered assistant for user group leaders
- **Community Dashboard**: For tracking and visualizing your group's growth
- **Content Templates**: For consistent communications
- **Automation Tools**: For social media and email scheduling
- **Feedback Forms**: For gathering structured input

By automating routine tasks, you can focus more on building relationships and creating valuable experiences for your members.

## Bonus Tip: Connect with Other User Group Leaders

Don't operate in isolation. Connect with other AWS User Group leaders to:

- Share best practices and lessons learned
- Collaborate on regional events or virtual meetups
- Discuss common challenges and solutions
- Exchange speaker recommendations
- Provide mutual support and encouragement

The AWS User Group Leader Slack channel is a great place to start these conversations.

## Conclusion

Running a successful AWS User Group requires dedication, but the impact you can have on your local tech community is immeasurable. By creating a space for learning, connection, and growth, you're not just helping people develop technical skillsâ€”you're building a community that supports professional development and innovation.

Remember that building a thriving user group takes time. Be patient, celebrate small wins, and continuously adapt based on feedback and changing needs.
