# About the AWS User Group Toolkit

The AWS User Group Toolkit is an open-source project designed to empower AWS User Group leaders with tools and resources to build thriving communities. Our mission is to simplify the process of managing user groups, organizing events, and engaging with community members.

## Our Mission

We believe that AWS User Groups play a vital role in the broader AWS community by:

- Providing a platform for knowledge sharing and learning
- Creating networking opportunities for AWS professionals
- Fostering innovation and collaboration
- Supporting career growth and professional development

Running a successful user group requires significant time and effort. The AWS User Group Toolkit aims to reduce this burden by providing automated tools and resources that streamline common tasks, allowing leaders to focus on what matters most: building meaningful connections within their communities.
